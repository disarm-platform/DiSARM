\title{Function to fit a 10 fold cross validated ML model. Currently only support binomial data.}
\usage{
cv_ml(points, layer_names, model_type = "randomforest", k = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A data.frame or sfc object containing `n_trials`, `n_positive` fields}

\item{layer_names}{Names of column corresponding covariates to use}

\item{model_type}{Either `randomForest`, in which case a random forest}

\item{k}{The number of folds to use
using the ranger package is fit or `hal`, in which case
a highly adaptive lasso using the hal9001 package is fit. Note the `hal` 
is computationally expensive and not recommended for large 
(>200) datasets.}
